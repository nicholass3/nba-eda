The project analyzes the NBA's recent history from the 2003-2004 season to the 2022-2023 season, focusing on team dynamics and player performance. Then, a predictive model was used to predict the win probability of an NBA team based on the provided information.  It addresses two main areas:

Home Advantage in the NBA:

- Examines if playing in a home arena provides a significant advantage.
- Investigates whether teams generally perform worse when playing away.

NBA Player Insights:
- Explores the evolution of offensive play styles across seasons.
- Analyzes the geographic distribution of playersâ€™ origins to determine if the NBA is a global league or still dominated by American players.
- Investigates the connection between player salaries and their performance.
- Studies the influence of players' physical traits on their on-court performances.
- The project uses data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive report on these topics.
